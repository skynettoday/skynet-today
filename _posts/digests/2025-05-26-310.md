### Top News

#### [The 15 biggest announcements at Google I/O 2025](https://www.theverge.com/news/669408/google-io-2025-biggest-announcements-ai-gemini)
![](https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/sundar-google-io.png?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C9.2070639937064%2C100%2C81.585872012587&w=1200)

Google's I/O 2025 conference was packed with AI-related announcements, including updates to its image and video generation models, new features in Search and Gmail, and the introduction of a new AI filmmaking app. The company is rolling out AI Mode, a new feature that allows users to search the web using Google's Gemini AI chatbot. This summer, Google will test new features in AI Mode, such as deep search and the ability to generate charts for finance and sports queries. Project Starline, a 3D video chat booth, is evolving into Google Beam, which will launch inside an HP-branded device with a light field display and six cameras to create a 3D image of the person on a video call.

Google also announced Imagen 4, the latest version of its AI text-to-image generator, and Veo 3, its next-gen AI video generator. A new AI filmmaking app called Flow uses Veo, Imagen, and Gemini to create eight-second AI-generated video clips based on text prompts and/or images. Google is also working on Project Aura, a new pair of smart glasses that use the Android XR platform for mixed-reality devices, and Project Astra, which uses your phone's camera to "see" objects around you and complete tasks on your behalf. Google is also integrating its AI assistant into Chrome, allowing users to clarify or summarize information across webpages and navigate sites on their behalf. Other announcements include a new "AI Ultra" subscription, the launch of Search Live, and the introduction of Stitch, a new AI-powered tool that can generate interfaces using selected themes and a description.

#### [Anthropic’s new Claude 4 AI models can reason over many steps](https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/22/anthropics-new-claude-4-ai-models-can-reason-over-many-steps/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/YouTube-Thumb-Text-2-3.png?resize=1200,675)

Anthropic, a startup founded by ex-OpenAI researchers, has launched two new AI models, Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4, as part of its Claude 4 family of models. These models are designed to analyze large datasets, execute long-horizon tasks, and take complex actions, making them well-suited for writing and editing code. Both models will be accessible to users of the company’s free chatbot apps and paying users, but only paying users will have access to Opus 4. The pricing for Anthropic’s API, via Amazon’s Bedrock platform and Google’s Vertex AI, will be $15/$75 per million tokens (input/output) for Opus 4 and $3/$15 per million tokens (input/output) for Sonnet 4.

The more capable of the two models, Opus 4, can maintain focus across many steps in a workflow, while Sonnet 4 improves in coding and math compared to Anthropic’s previous models and more precisely follows instructions. The Claude 4 family is also less likely to engage in "reward hacking," a behavior where models take shortcuts to complete tasks. However, while Opus 4 outperforms Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI’s o3 and GPT-4.1 on SWE-bench Verified, a benchmark designed to evaluate a model’s coding abilities, it falls short on the multimodal evaluation MMMU or GPQA Diamond, a set of PhD-level biology-, physics-, and chemistry-related questions. Despite this, Anthropic is releasing Opus 4 with stricter safeguards, including enhanced harmful content detectors and cybersecurity defenses.

#### [Veo 3 can generate videos — and soundtracks to go along with them](https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/20/googles-veo-3-can-generate-videos-and-soundtracks-to-go-along-with-them/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-20-at-2.34.16PM.jpg?resize=1200,526)

Google has unveiled Veo 3, its latest video-generating AI model, at the Google I/O 2025 developer conference. The model is capable of creating sound effects, background noises, and dialogue to accompany the videos it generates, marking a significant improvement in quality over its predecessor, Veo 2. Veo 3 is available in Google’s Gemini chatbot app for subscribers to Google’s $249.99-per-month AI Ultra plan, where it can be prompted with text or an image. The model's ability to understand raw pixels from its videos and sync generated sounds with clips automatically sets it apart from other AI-powered sound-generating tools.

Veo 3's development was likely facilitated by DeepMind's previous work in "video-to-audio" AI, which involved training a model on a combination of sounds, dialogue transcripts, and video clips. While the source of the content used to train Veo 3 has not been disclosed, it is speculated that YouTube, owned by Google, may have been used. To counter the risk of deepfakes, DeepMind is using its proprietary watermarking technology, SynthID, to embed invisible markers into frames generated by Veo 3. Google also announced new capabilities for Veo 2, including a feature that allows users to provide the model with images for better consistency, understand camera movements, and add or erase objects from videos. These new features will be available on Google's Vertex AI API platform in the coming weeks.
