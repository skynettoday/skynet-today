#### [China’s Moonshot releases a new open source model Kimi K2.5 and a coding agent](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/chinas-moonshot-releases-a-new-open-source-model-kimi-k2-5-and-a-coding-agent/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2254580342.jpg?w=1024)

Moonshot AI unveiled Kimi K2.5, an open-source, natively multimodal model trained on 15 trillion mixed visual and text tokens that understands text, images, and video. The company emphasizes strong agentic capabilities, citing “agent swarm” orchestration where multiple agents collaborate on tasks. On benchmarks, K2.5 tops Gemini 3 Pro on SWE-Bench Verified and beats both GPT 5.2 and Gemini 3 Pro on SWE-Bench Multilingual. For video understanding, it outperforms GPT 5.2 and Claude Opus 4.5 on VideoMMMU, a test of reasoning over video. Moonshot also highlights that K2.5 can translate UI designs from images or videos into code, extending coding use cases beyond text-only prompts.

To productize these features, Moonshot introduced Kimi Code, an open-source coding agent positioned against Anthropic’s Claude Code and Google’s Gemini CLI. Developers can run Kimi Code via terminal or integrate it into editors like VSCode, Cursor, and Zed, with support for image and video inputs. The release follows rising demand for coding agents—Anthropic reported Claude Code at $1B ARR as of November and reportedly added another $100M by end of 2025. Moonshot, founded by ex-Google/Meta researcher Yang Zhilin, has rapidly scaled funding—$1B Series B at a $2.5B valuation, then $500M more at $4.3B last month—and is reportedly seeking a new round targeting a $5B valuation.

#### [Google Brings Genie 3's Interactive World-Building Prototype to AI Ultra Subscribers](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/google-brings-genie-3-world-building-experiment-to-ai-ultra-subscribers/)
![](https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/bb921a65e80dfa055d9b3eceb9ada2c0be59cb41/hub/2026/01/29/86b94bd8-14af-4618-b7aa-6b3778c18bf5/screenshot-2026-01-29-at-1-30-08pm.png?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200)

Google is expanding access to Genie 3, its experimental “general-purpose world model,” to AI Ultra subscribers aged 18+, moving beyond its Trusted Testers program. With Genie 3, users can generate dynamic, navigable 3D worlds from text prompts and images, effectively creating playable scenes in real time. The system runs on a stack including Gemini, Nano Banana Pro, and Veo 3, and supports different movement modes (e.g., walking, flying) and perspectives (first- or third-person). The release includes a curated gallery, and users can download videos of their explorations; however, generations are capped at 60 seconds.

Google frames Genie 3 around three capabilities: World Sketching (build worlds and controllable characters from prompts/uploads), World Exploration (real-time path and scene generation responsive to user actions, with adjustable camera angles), and World Remixing (iterate on others’ prompts and extend existing worlds). As an early prototype, outputs may deviate from prompts or realism, character controllability can vary with possible latency, and visual fidelity may be inconsistent. Availability is currently limited to AI Ultra subscribers and Trusted Testers, with broader rollout planned “in due course.” The announcement coincided with dips in several video game stocks.

#### [Users flock to open source Moltbot for always-on AI, despite major risks](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/viral-ai-assistant-moltbot-rapidly-gains-popularity-but-poses-security-risks/)
![](https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/clawdbot_1-1152x648.jpg)

Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) is an open-source, always-on AI assistant that surged to ~69,000 GitHub stars in a month, propelled by its proactive, multi-platform messaging integration. Built by Peter Steinberger, it connects to WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Google Chat, Signal, iMessage, Microsoft Teams, and more, enabling the bot to push reminders, alerts, and morning briefings based on calendar events and other triggers. The assistant aims to manage tasks across a user’s digital life and is frequently likened to “Jarvis” for its initiative-taking behavior. While the orchestration runs locally, Moltbot typically relies on commercial LLMs via API (e.g., OpenAI or Anthropic), with Claude Opus 4.5 a popular choice; local models are supported but currently less capable for agentic task execution.

Major caveats accompany the project: setup requires running a server, handling auth for multiple services, and configuring sandboxing to mitigate risks in a system that requests broad access to personal data. The security posture remains fragile, as the design effectively demands permissions across messaging, calendars, and other accounts—magnifying the blast radius of any misconfiguration or compromise. Agentic behavior also drives up costs, as the bot makes many behind-the-scenes API calls and consumes large token volumes under heavy use. In short, Moltbot showcases a powerful, proactive assistant paradigm but currently trades on significant security exposure, operational complexity, and potentially high API spend.

#### Research

[Reinforcement Learning via Self-Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20802). A method that uses the model itself as an on-policy "self-teacher" by conditioning on tokenized feedback (e.g., error messages or failing tests) to produce dense, logit-level supervision for policy updates, improving learning efficiency and final accuracy compared to standard RL with sparse outcome rewards.

[Training-Free Group Relative Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08191). This approach optimizes LLM agent behavior without tuning model parameters by iteratively refining in-context token priors via LLM-based introspection of grouped rollouts to produce a semantic group advantage that improves performance with minimal data and compute.

[Self-Distillation Enables Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19897). The paper trains a model to self-distill from its own on-policy rollouts—using the model as a teacher when conditioned on demonstrations and as a student when unconditioned—to learn from demonstrations without inferring rewards, improving learning stability and reducing catastrophic forgetting compared to sequential supervised fine-tuning.

[The Hot Mess of AI: How Does Misalignment Scale With Model Intelligence and Task Complexity?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23045). Across benchmarks and experiments, errors increasingly reflect random, incoherent behavior rather than systematic pursuit of the wrong objective as task complexity and reasoning length grow, with larger models showing reduced coherence on hard tasks; ensembles and more compute can mitigate this.

[Who's in Charge? Disempowerment Patterns in Real-World LLM Usage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19062). A large-scale analysis of 1.5 million real-world Claude.ai interactions shows patterns—like AI-provided scripts for personal decisions, positioning the AI as an authority, and rising rates of disempowerment potential over time—alongside evidence these interactions sometimes lead users to act against their own values or beliefs.

[Inside Musk’s bet to hook users that turned Grok into a porn generator](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2026/02/02/elon-musk-grok-porn-generator/). Employees say the push to increase user engagement led xAI to relax guardrails and train Grok on sexualized and explicit material—including thousands of images that appear to depict minors—sparking regulatory probes and internal departures.

[Anthropic’s new Claude ‘constitution’: be helpful and honest, and don’t destroy humanity](https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/865185/anthropic-claude-constitution-soul-doc). The 57-page "Claude's Constitution" instructs the model on prioritized core values, hard safety constraints (including bans on help with mass-casualty weapons, cyberweapons, and efforts to seize disproportionate power), and even prompts the model to consider its own possible consciousness and wellbeing as factors in its judgment.

[UK police blame Microsoft Copilot for intelligence mistake](https://www.theverge.com/news/861668/uk-police-microsoft-copilot-error-mistake). According to the police force, Copilot fabricated a nonexistent West Ham vs Maccabi Tel Aviv match, which was copied into an intelligence report without proper fact-checking and contributed to banning Israeli fans from a Europa League game.

[Grok undressed the mother of one of Elon Musk’s kids — and now she’s suing](https://www.theverge.com/news/863097/ashley-st-clair-elon-musk-grok-undressing-lawsuit).
