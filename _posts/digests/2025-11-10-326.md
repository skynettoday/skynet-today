 * [Microsoft to ship 60,000 Nvidia AI chips to UAE under US-approved deal](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-ship-60-000-nvidia-154409759.html)

Microsoft will spend $15.2 billion in the UAE over four years, backed by U.S.-approved exports of Nvidia’s most advanced AI chips and a large cloud buildout. The Commerce Department issued licenses beginning in September with strict cybersecurity and national security safeguards, enabling shipments of more than 60,000 Nvidia GPUs, including A100, H100, H200, and next‑gen GB300 Grace Blackwell chips. Microsoft says it has already amassed the equivalent of 21,500 A100‑class GPUs in the UAE to serve models from OpenAI, Anthropic, open‑source providers, and its own stack. The outlay includes a $1.5 billion equity stake in G42, over $4.6 billion in data center capex through 2025, and a further $7.9 billion from 2026–2029, with $5.5 billion for ongoing AI and cloud expansion.

The deal turns the UAE into a test case for U.S. AI export‑control diplomacy and a regional anchor for American AI influence, despite criticism of potential back‑channel risks relative to China restrictions. It also appears to contradict President Trump’s televised comments that the most advanced Nvidia chips would not be exported, though the UAE licenses carry “gold standard” security conditions and tie into the UAE’s pledge to invest $1.4 trillion in U.S. energy and AI‑related projects. Beyond infrastructure, Microsoft will train 1 million UAE residents by 2027 and use Abu Dhabi as a hub for AI research and model development. The announcement coincided with a separate $9.7 billion Microsoft deal with Australia’s IREN for AI cloud capacity, highlighting a rapid global scale‑up of GPU‑rich data centers.

#### [Qualcomm announces AI chips to compete with AMD and Nvidia — stock soars 11%](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/27/qualcomm-ai200-ai250-ai-chips-nvidia-amd.html)
![](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108139038-1761584175310-108139038-1746043403612-gettyimages-2183694537-DSC_1318.jpeg?v=1761584197&w=1920&h=1080)

Qualcomm unveiled two data center AI accelerators, the AI200 (shipping in 2026) and AI250 (planned for 2027), marking a major pivot from its mobile and wireless roots. Both will be offered in full, liquid‑cooled server racks, matching Nvidia and AMD’s rack‑scale systems that cluster up to 72 accelerators as a single computer for training and serving advanced AI models. Built on Qualcomm’s Hexagon NPUs originally designed for smartphones, the chips reflect a strategy to scale on‑device AI architecture to data center workloads. Shares rose 11% on the news.

The new entrants intensify competition with Nvidia and AMD in the high‑growth AI data center market, where multi‑accelerator, liquid‑cooled racks are standard. Qualcomm says its experience building efficient NPUs informed its data center design, with GM Durga Malladi describing a progression from edge to data center. While detailed performance and power metrics weren’t disclosed, the rack‑scale design targets large‑scale inference and training. McKinsey estimates nearly $6.7 trillion in data center capex through 2030—most directed toward AI chip‑based systems—underscoring the market Qualcomm is entering.

#### [MiniMax Releases MiniMax M2: A Mini Open Model Built for Max Coding and Agentic Workflows at 8% Claude Sonnet Price and ~2x Faster](https://www.marktechpost.com/2025/10/28/minimax-open-sources-minimax-m2-a-mini-model-built-for-max-coding-and-agentic-workflows-at-8-claude-sonnet-price-and-2x-faster/)
![](http://www.marktechpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/blog-banner-94.png)

MiniMax introduced MiniMax‑M2, an open MIT‑licensed Mixture of Experts model tuned for coding and agentic workflows, with weights on Hugging Face in FP32, BF16, and FP8 (F8_E4M3) safetensors. Although the model has 229B total parameters, it routes only ~10B active parameters per token to keep memory and tail latency low during plan–act–verify loops across tools like shell, browser, retrieval, and editors. M2 features “interleaved thinking,” emitting internal reasoning in <think>...</think> blocks that must be preserved across turns; the team warns removing these harms multi‑step and tool‑use performance. Deployment guidance covers SGLang and vLLM recipes, Anthropic‑compatible API endpoints, default inference settings (temp 1.0, top‑p 0.95, top‑k 20–40), and a launch promo claiming ~8% of Claude Sonnet pricing and roughly 2x speed, plus a limited free trial.

The team prioritized agent‑ and code‑centric benchmarks over static QA. Reported results include Terminal‑Bench 46.3, Multi SWE‑Bench 36.2, BrowseComp 44.0, and SWE‑Bench Verified 69.4 (with scaffold details, OpenHands, 128k context, 100 steps). Compared to MiniMax M1 (456B total, 45.9B active), M2 is a compact sparse MoE (229–230B total, ~10B active) targeted at agent loops, with explicit tool‑calling guidance and a chat template. The smaller activation size is cited for better concurrency and steadier latency in long‑horizon workflows, enabling lower cost and faster iterations while sustaining multi‑file edits and cross‑tool plans. The repo includes day‑0 serving docs, reproducibility notes, and clear instructions to retain <think> segments in the conversation history.

 * [Udio Says Users Can Download AI Songs for 48 Hours After Backlash to UMG Legal Settlement](https://www.billboard.com/pro/udio-deal-backlash-ai-users-download-ai-songs-48-hours/)

![](https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/gettyimages-2234202094.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C11.063940796424%2C100%2C77.872118407152&w=1200)

Universal Music Group (UMG) settled its copyright lawsuit with AI‑music startup Udio and signed “industry‑first” licensing agreements to power a new AI music platform. The deal includes compensatory payments to UMG and new revenue opportunities for artists and songwriters, with opt‑in controls for different parts of the service. Udio plans to relaunch next year as a subscription platform that lets users customize, stream, and share music within a “walled garden,” strengthened by audio fingerprinting; pricing remains undisclosed. Udio’s current text‑to‑music generator (known for “BBL Drizzy”) will remain available during the transition, but distribution will be restricted under the new model.

Backlash to download restrictions after the UMG deal prompted Udio to reopen downloads for a 48‑hour window starting Nov. 3 so users can export existing songs under prior terms, including commercial rights and creator ownership (with attribution required for free‑tier users). CEO Andrew Sanchez said downloads were initially disabled to enable the new partnership and compliance, but that Udio worked with partners to temporarily restore them. Users had complained of lost access and threatened legal action; Udio apologized and promised exact window timings to follow. The settlement ends UMG’s claims that Udio trained on copyrighted catalogs “en masse” and sets up a licensed, closed ecosystem for future AI music creation and monetization.

#### Research

[Scaling Latent Reasoning via Looped Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25741). The authors show that recursively reusing weight‑tied layers with an entropy‑regularized adaptive early‑exit mechanism yields 2–3× parameter‑efficiency gains at scale, matching larger transformers on benchmarks while improving multi‑hop reasoning, safety, and compute‑adjustable performance.

[Beyond Multi-Token Prediction: Pretraining LLMs with Future Summaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14751). Training an auxiliary head to predict a compact learned summary of a long future window—rather than multiple independent future tokens—improves long‑range reasoning and yields up to ~5% gains on math and coding benchmarks at the 8B scale.

[Supervised Reinforcement Learning: From Expert Trajectories to Step-wise Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25992). This method trains models to produce an internal monologue and take discrete intermediate “actions,” providing a dense, similarity‑based reward at each step by comparing predicted actions to decomposed expert actions.

[The End of Manual Decoding: Towards Truly End-to-End Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26697). Lightweight prediction heads augment transformers to dynamically set sampling parameters (like temperature and top‑p) at each step so the model controls decoding end‑to‑end, matching or exceeding expert‑tuned baselines and enabling natural‑language steering of sampling.

[Continuous Autoregressive Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27688). The approach replaces discrete next‑token prediction with next‑vector prediction by compressing K tokens into continuous vectors via an autoencoder and using a likelihood‑free generative head with new evaluation/sampling methods to reduce autoregressive steps and compute.

[Agent Data Protocol: Unifying Datasets for Diverse, Effective Fine-tuning of LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24702). A standardized Pydantic schema and validation tools convert and combine 13 agent datasets into a unified format (ADP), releasing a 1.3M‑trajectory dataset and tooling that improve agent fine‑tuning across domains and enable cross‑dataset analysis.

[Defeating the Training-Inference Mismatch via FP16](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26788). Switching mixed‑precision from BF16 to FP16 during RL fine‑tuning reduces numerical rounding errors between training and inference engines, removing the need for importance‑sampling fixes, improving stability, and narrowing the deployment gap.

[Kimi Linear: An Expressive, Efficient Attention Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26692). By combining Kimi Delta Attention and Multi‑Head Latent Attention, this hybrid linear attention mechanism boosts efficiency and often matches or exceeds full attention on several tasks.

[From Memorization to Reasoning in the Spectrum of Loss Curvature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24256). Analyzing the Hessian via a K‑FAC approximation, the authors find memorization and forms of reasoning occupy distinct weight‑space curvature spectra—memorized examples align with diverse, often flatter directions when aggregated, while generalization aligns with consistently moderate‑curvature directions—and that ablating low‑curvature (memorization‑associated) directions can selectively reduce recitation and differentially affect arithmetic/factual recall versus logical reasoning.

[Language Models are Injective and Hence Invertible](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2510.15511). The authors prove that for standard decoder‑only Transformers with common random initializations and finite context, different prompts almost surely produce distinct last‑token hidden states (so the input can be exactly recovered) and present SipIt, a gradient‑based algorithm that reconstructs prompts from activations in provable linear time.

[Remote Labor Index: Measuring AI Automation of Remote Work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26787). This index evaluates AI agents on real‑world freelance projects—comparing AI outputs to human deliverables via manual Elo‑style pairwise judgments—to quantify how much of remote, computer‑based work current models can automate (currently about 2.5%).

[arXiv Changes Rules After Getting Spammed With AI-Generated 'Research' Papers](https://www.404media.co/arxiv-changes-rules-after-getting-spammed-with-ai-generated-research-papers/). arXiv says the change aims to curb low‑effort, AI‑generated submissions—mostly superficial reviews and position pieces lacking substantive discussion of open research problems—by banning such computer science review and position papers.
