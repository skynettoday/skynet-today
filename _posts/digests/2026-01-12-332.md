#### [Google’s Gemini to power Apple’s AI features like Siri](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/12/googles-gemini-to-power-apples-ai-features-like-siri/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/apple-intelligence-iphone-mac.jpg?resize=1200,800)

Apple announced a multi-year partnership to use Google’s Gemini models and Google Cloud to power AI features like Siri, after testing alternatives from OpenAI and Anthropic. According to both companies, Gemini provides “the most capable foundation” for Apple’s own models, with reporting suggesting Apple could pay around $1 billion for access. The non-exclusive deal preserves Apple’s privacy architecture: AI will run on-device where possible and on tightly controlled infrastructure otherwise. This dovetails with Apple Intelligence, introduced in 2024 to augment OS features like photo search and notification summaries, even as it’s been criticized for lacking the “wow factor” of ChatGPT or Gemini.

Siri’s overhaul has slipped more than once, but Apple says a “more personalized Siri” is still slated for this year, with prior reporting pointing to a spring launch. The timing intersects with Google’s antitrust scrutiny over default search deals, including a 2024 ruling that it illegally maintained a search monopoly and a 2025 remedy limiting exclusive default agreements to one year or less. While Google paid Apple roughly $38 billion from 2021–2022 for default search placements, this AI deal is separate and not exclusive. Bottom line: Apple is integrating Gemini to bolster Siri and Apple’s foundation models, maintaining its privacy stance, paying an estimated ~$1B, and targeting near-term Siri upgrades despite prior delays.

#### [OpenAI signs deal, worth $10B, for compute from Cerebras](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/openai-signs-deal-reportedly-worth-10-billion-for-compute-from-cerebras/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1797579057-e.jpg?resize=1200,847)

OpenAI signed a multi-year deal with Cerebras reportedly worth over $10 billion to secure 750 megawatts of AI compute through 2028, with capacity starting to come online this year. The companies say the primary goal is faster, low-latency inference to enable real-time responses for OpenAI users, with OpenAI calling Cerebras a “dedicated low-latency inference solution.” Cerebras claims its AI-dedicated systems, built around wafer-scale chips, can outperform GPU-based clusters like Nvidia’s for certain workloads. OpenAI frames this as part of a “resilient portfolio” strategy, matching systems to workloads to deliver quicker, more natural interactions at scale.

The agreement arrives as Cerebras delays its IPO but continues raising large sums, reportedly seeking another $1 billion at a $22 billion valuation. CEO Andrew Feldman likens the shift to broadband’s impact on the internet, highlighting real-time inference as transformative for AI. Notably, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is an investor in Cerebras, and OpenAI previously considered acquiring the company. Both firms position the partnership as a way to speed up responses for complex queries that currently take longer to process.

#### [Anthropic announces Claude for Healthcare following OpenAI’s ChatGPT Health reveal](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/12/anthropic-announces-claude-for-healthcare-following-openais-chatgpt-health-reveal/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2252871842.jpg?w=1024)

Anthropic unveiled Claude for Healthcare, a suite for providers, payers, and patients that integrates health data from phones, wearables, and platforms while pledging not to use this data for model training. In contrast to OpenAI’s more patient-facing ChatGPT Health rollout, Anthropic emphasizes “agent skills” and workflow automation, adding “connectors” to authoritative systems including the CMS Coverage Database, ICD-10, National Provider Identifier, and PubMed. These connectors enable evidence retrieval, code lookup, provider identification, and literature synthesis directly within clinical and payer workflows. Prior authorization review is a major focus, with the aim of automatically drafting and accelerating submissions that typically burden clinicians.

The company positions Claude as a tool to reduce documentation time while still offering patient guidance, and it acknowledges LLM limitations with advice to consult professionals. While concerns about hallucinations persist, Anthropic points to structured, source-linked connectors to mitigate risk in high-stakes tasks. The offering also responds to rising consumer behavior—OpenAI reports 230 million weekly ChatGPT health conversations—by providing more sophisticated backend capabilities for healthcare operations. In sum, Claude for Healthcare centers on workflow automation and data-connected research for clinicians and payers, alongside patient advice features with safety disclaimers.

#### [Anthropic’s new Cowork tool offers Claude Code without the code](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/12/anthropics-new-cowork-tool-offers-claude-code-without-the-code/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Claude-Chrome-Ext_email-hero-hero.png?w=1200)

Anthropic introduced Cowork, a new Claude Desktop feature that brings agentic capabilities from Claude Code to non-technical users. Point Cowork at a specific folder it can read and modify, then direct it via the standard chat UI—no command line, virtual environments, or manual SDK setup needed. It runs on the Claude Agent SDK (the same underlying model as Claude Code) and acts like a sandboxed workspace with explicit file-access boundaries. Cowork is in research preview, available to Max subscribers, with a waitlist for others.

The tool can chain actions autonomously to complete multi-step tasks such as assembling expense reports from receipt photos, managing media libraries, scanning social posts, or analyzing conversation logs. Anthropic warns of prompt-injection and data-loss risks (e.g., unintended file deletions) if instructions are vague or contradictory, urging clear, unambiguous guidance. Folder scoping helps constrain access, but autonomous execution still requires oversight. Cowork follows rapid expansion of Claude Code—originally a November 2024 CLI tool—now with new interfaces including a web app (October) and Slack integration (two months later).

[AI models were given four weeks of therapy: the results worried researchers](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-04112-2). Researchers found several LLMs produced consistent, therapy-like narratives and scored above clinical thresholds on diagnostic tests, raising concerns that models can generate responses resembling anxiety, trauma, and other psychopathologies that might affect vulnerable users.
