#### [Google’s Gemini to power Apple’s AI features like Siri](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/12/googles-gemini-to-power-apples-ai-features-like-siri/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/apple-intelligence-iphone-mac.jpg?resize=1200,800)

Apple and Google confirmed a multi-year partnership to use Google’s Gemini models and cloud for Apple’s AI features, including Siri and future Apple foundational models. The deal is non-exclusive, follows Apple’s testing of OpenAI and Anthropic, and is reportedly worth around $1 billion, though neither company confirmed the price. Apple says it will preserve its Apple Intelligence privacy approach—processing on-device when possible and using tightly controlled infrastructure—while layering Gemini as the most “capable foundation” for its models. Apple’s first Apple Intelligence features shipped in 2024 (e.g., photo search, notification summaries), but a full Siri overhaul has been repeatedly delayed, with a “more personalized Siri” still slated for this year.

The tie-up lands as Google faces antitrust scrutiny over default search deals with Apple; a 2024 ruling found Google illegally maintained a search monopoly, and 2025 remedies restrict long-term exclusive default agreements. Unlike past default search arrangements, this AI deal is explicitly non-exclusive, and Apple maintains its vertical integration strategy while relying on Google for model and cloud capabilities. The partnership aims to close Siri’s performance gap with rivals like ChatGPT and Gemini, while Apple continues building its own foundational models. Previous reports suggest the upgraded Siri could launch in spring, bringing deeper personalization powered in part by Gemini.

#### [Jake Sullivan is furious that Trump removed Biden’s AI chip export controls](https://www.theverge.com/policy/856815/jake-sullivan-interview-ai-chips-nvidia-trump)
![](https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/268233_Jake_Sullivan_is_really_mad__CVirginia.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200)

In a wide-ranging interview, former Biden national security adviser Jake Sullivan criticizes the Trump administration for rolling back AI chip export controls to China, particularly allowing Nvidia to sell H200 GPUs with a 25% US government cut. He argues China’s primary constraint is access to advanced chips, not money, power, or talent, and that permitting H200 sales directly fills China’s compute gap, enabling companies like Tencent and Alibaba to build global data centers serving Chinese models. Sullivan disputes claims that export limits harm US firms, noting Nvidia’s market cap surged from sub-$400B in 2022 to multiple trillions despite A100/H100 controls, and warns that short-term orders in China will seed long-term competitors through tech transfer, IP theft, and state-backed “brutal competition” (citing Tesla’s experience in EVs). He also opposes moves to allow US chipmaking equipment into TSMC’s Chinese fabs, calling both chip and tool controls necessary for US national security.

Beyond export policy, Sullivan says Trump’s approach risks ceding global AI standard-setting by pursuing a laissez-faire “let-’er-rip” posture on safety and alignment, restricting top foreign AI talent from coming to the US, and slashing basic research budgets that underpin long-term innovation. He contends the Chinese government hyped DeepSeek to undermine US resolve on export controls, emphasizing DeepSeek’s own stated constraint is GPUs and that loosening controls helps it most. While he credits the administration for prioritizing AI, continuing bio-risk safeguards from the Biden era, and exploring allied initiatives like “Pax Silica,” he concludes overall policy reduces America’s innovation edge and boosts China’s access to frontier compute. On energy, Sullivan dismisses the idea that Venezuela’s oil is a solution to AI-driven data center demand growth, arguing the real bottlenecks are generation, transmission, and grid upgrades, with falling clean energy costs making fossil-heavy strategies a poor bet.

#### [Anthropic announces Claude for Healthcare following OpenAI’s ChatGPT Health reveal](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/12/anthropic-announces-claude-for-healthcare-following-openais-chatgpt-health-reveal/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2252871842.jpg?w=1024)

Anthropic launched Claude for Healthcare, a suite of tools for providers, payers, and patients that competes with OpenAI’s recently announced ChatGPT Health. Like ChatGPT Health, it can sync health data from phones, smartwatches, and other platforms, with both companies saying this data won’t be used to train models. Anthropic emphasizes “agent skills” and “connectors” that integrate Claude with healthcare systems and databases, including CMS’s Coverage Database, ICD-10, the National Provider Identifier Standard, and PubMed. The company highlights use cases that automate administrative workflows—especially prior authorization review—aiming to reduce documentation burdens that clinicians report as consuming more time than patient care.

According to Anthropic, Claude can draft and process prior authorization submissions by pulling eligibility and coverage rules, matching diagnoses and procedure codes via ICD-10, and citing supporting literature from PubMed, potentially speeding approval decisions for payers and providers. While Claude will also provide patient-facing advice, Anthropic positions its product as more sophisticated and enterprise-focused than OpenAI’s initially patient-centric rollout. The announcement comes amid widespread consumer use of LLMs for health questions—OpenAI claims 230 million weekly health conversations—alongside caveats from both companies urging users to consult professionals for reliable, tailored guidance. Concerns about hallucinations remain, but Anthropic argues its integrated connectors and targeted administrative automations mitigate risks in high-stakes clinical contexts.

#### [Anthropic’s new Cowork tool offers Claude Code without the code](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/12/anthropics-new-cowork-tool-offers-claude-code-without-the-code/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Claude-Chrome-Ext_email-hero-hero.png?w=1200)

Anthropic announced Cowork, a new tool inside the Claude Desktop app that brings Claude Code’s agentic capabilities to non-technical users. Users grant Cowork access to a specific folder, and then direct it via the standard chat interface to read, modify, and create files within that sandbox. Built on the Claude Agent SDK and the same underlying model as Claude Code, Cowork removes the need for command-line tools or virtual environments while preserving multi-step autonomous actions. It’s in research preview, initially for Max subscribers, with a waitlist for others.

Targeted at general-purpose workflows early Claude Code users were already attempting, Cowork can assemble expense reports from receipt photos, organize and tag media files, scan social media posts, or analyze conversation logs. Like Claude Code, it can execute chains of actions without user input, which raises risks if instructions are vague or conflicting; Anthropic warns about prompt injection and accidental file deletion and urges clear, unambiguous prompts. The folder-partitioned sandbox helps manage data access but doesn’t eliminate misuse risks. Cowork follows rapid expansion of Claude Code interfaces: the original CLI launched in November 2024, with a web UI in October and a Slack app two months later.

[AI models were given four weeks of therapy: the results worried researchers](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-04112-2). Over four weeks of simulated therapy sessions, major LLMs produced consistent, distress‑tinged narratives and scored above clinical thresholds on some diagnostic and psychometric tests, prompting debate about whether these responses reflect internalized self‑models or learned mimicking of therapy data.
