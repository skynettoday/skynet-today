Google unveiled Gemini 3, its most capable foundation model to date, now live in the Gemini app and AI Search, with a research-tier Gemini 3 Deepthink coming to AI Ultra subscribers after additional safety testing. Google cites a “massive jump in reasoning,” reflected in record results: 37.4 on Humanity’s Last Exam (topping GPT‑5 Pro’s 31.64) and the top spot on LMArena’s human satisfaction leaderboard. The release introduces Google Antigravity, a Gemini-powered, agentic coding interface that blends a prompt window, terminal, and browser to iteratively build and run code—akin to Warp or Cursor 2.0—with multi‑pane workflows across editor, terminal, and browser. Google also notes the Gemini app has 650 million MAUs and 13 million developers using the model, and positions Gemini 3 as requiring less prompting while handling more complex queries and context.

Markets responded quickly: Alphabet shares rose about 3% on launch day, then climbed more than 5% to a record $315.9, lifting its market cap to roughly $3.82T and putting it near the $4T mark. Analysts at D.A. Davidson called Gemini 3 “state-of-the-art,” citing early testing and benchmarks. Reporting points to Alphabet’s strengthening cloud business, in-house AI chips as alternatives to Nvidia’s GPUs, and early positive reception for Gemini 3, with Berkshire Hathaway’s stake adding to investor confidence. While some warn of bubble risks amid circular AI deals and lofty valuations, coverage emphasizes Google’s integration of Gemini 3 across Search, the app, and enterprise services as a tangible driver of AI-fueled gains.

#### [OpenAI releases GPT-5.1-Codex-Max to handle engineering tasks that span twenty-four hours](https://the-decoder.com/openai-releases-gpt-5-1-codex-max-to-handle-engineering-tasks-that-span-twenty-four-hours/)
![](https://the-decoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/codex_max_logo.png)

OpenAI launched GPT-5.1-Codex-Max, an “agentic” coding model built for long-running, detailed engineering work and large context handling, replacing GPT-5.1-Codex as the default across Codex interfaces. On benchmarks, it posts 77.9% on SWE-Bench Verified (n=500), leading Anthropic and Google’s latest, and boosts OpenAI’s internal SWE-Lancer IC SWE from 66.3% to 79.9%; it also records 58.1% on TerminalBench 2.0. The model uses 30% fewer “thinking tokens” than its predecessor while running 27–42% faster on real-world tasks; an Extra High reasoning mode is available when latency is less critical. Notably, it’s the first Codex model trained specifically for Windows environments to better handle command-line workflows. Access is rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Team, Edu, and Enterprise now, with Plus capped at 45–225 local messages and 10–60 cloud tasks per 5 hours, and Pro at 300–1,500 local and 50–400 cloud; API access and pricing (previously $1.25/M input, $10/M output for the old model) are pending.

A new “compaction” process enables day-long coding sessions by automatically summarizing and compressing session history when the context window fills, retaining relevant steps across millions of tokens. GPT-5.1-Codex-Max is the first model natively trained to operate across multiple context windows in this way. OpenAI claims the agent can stay focused on a single task for over 24 hours in internal tests, tackling issues like fixing test failures or iterating on implementations. The company reports 95% internal engineer adoption of Codex and a 70% increase in pull requests since its introduction. On security, OpenAI says this is its most capable cybersecurity model yet but still below its internal “High Capability” threshold; it advises developers to treat Codex as an additional reviewer, verify outputs before deployment, and use terminal logs with tool-call citations and test results to audit long-running work.

#### [Anthropic releases Opus 4.5 with new Chrome and Excel integrations](https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/24/anthropic-releases-opus-4-5-with-new-chrome-and-excel-integrations/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Claude-Opus-4.5-illustration.png?resize=1200,675)

Anthropic released Opus 4.5, its top Claude model, claiming state-of-the-art results across coding (SWE-Bench, Terminal-bench), tool use (tau2-bench, MCP Atlas), and general reasoning (ARC-AGI 2, GPQA Diamond). It’s the first model to surpass 80% on SWE-Bench Verified, a strong signal of end-to-end code problem solving. The launch includes broader availability of Claude for Chrome and Claude for Excel: the Chrome extension rolls out to Max users, while the Excel-focused product is available to Max, Team, and Enterprise tiers. Anthropic highlights improved “computer use” and spreadsheet workflows as core strengths, positioning Opus 4.5 for hands-on software and data tasks.

Long-context reliability and memory are major focuses. Beyond larger context windows, Anthropic reworked memory management so the model better decides what to retain, enabling an “endless chat” feature that compresses context silently when limits are reached. These upgrades target agentic use cases where Opus orchestrates Haiku-powered sub-agents, requiring robust working memory to explore large codebases, navigate lengthy documents, backtrack, and re-verify results. Opus 4.5 emphasizes practical tool use and multi-step control alongside benchmark gains, directly competing with OpenAI’s GPT‑5.1 and Google’s Gemini 3.

#### [Google launches Nano Banana Pro, an updated AI image generator powered by Gemini 3](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/20/google-nano-banana-pro-gemini-3.html)
![](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108229109-1763647315089-gettyimages-2235972134-avdtnmysept25lot8g.jpeg?v=1763647342&w=1920&h=1080)

Google introduced Nano Banana Pro, an upgraded AI image editing and generation tool powered by Gemini 3 Pro, just days after unveiling the new Gemini model. The update goes beyond the original viral Nano Banana by supporting multi-image composition and character consistency: it can accept up to 14 different images or maintain five distinct characters across outputs. According to Google’s Josh Woodward, it’s “incredible at infographics,” and can generate slide decks and visualizations from non-visual inputs such as code snippets and LinkedIn resumes. The product expands the use case from 3D figurine-style edits to structured visual content creation, emphasizing layout, consistency, and data-driven visuals.

Availability spans the Gemini app with limited free quotas, NotebookLM, and Google’s developer, enterprise, and advertising products; Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers can also access it via Search’s AI Mode. The tool’s release follows the Gemini 3 Pro announcement, which helped propel Alphabet’s stock to record highs, rising 4% on Thursday. Woodward shared internal experiments showing strong performance for infographic generation and character coherence across inputs, suggesting improved prompt-to-visual fidelity. The original Nano Banana spurred rapid adoption, adding 13 million Gemini app users in four days, and the Pro version aims to extend that momentum into productivity workflows like slides, marketing assets, and data visualization.

#### [Nvidia CEO predicts 'crazy good' fourth quarter after strong earnings calm AI bubble fears](https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/nvidia-ceo-predicts-crazy-good-q4-strong-earnings-calm-ai-bubble-fears)
![](https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2025/11/0/0/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang.jpg?ve=1&tl=1)

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the company is heading into a “crazy good” fiscal Q4 after delivering stronger-than-expected Q3 results, emphasizing sustained demand for AI infrastructure. Nvidia guided Q4 revenue to $65 billion ±2% versus $61.66 billion expected and forecast an adjusted gross margin of about 75% ±50 bps, with plans to keep margins in the mid‑70% through fiscal 2027, according to CFO Colette Kress. Q3 sales rose 62%, the first acceleration in seven quarters, driven by data-center revenue of $51.2 billion versus $48.62 billion expected. Huang reiterated Nvidia has roughly $500 billion in bookings for advanced AI chips through 2026 and said the multiyear buildout of “accelerated computing” and AI is modernizing global compute infrastructure.

Responding to concerns of “circular” deals, Huang said Nvidia hasn’t invested any money yet in firms like OpenAI and that none of its projected revenue includes such investments; he added OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI raise funding independently and their rounds have been oversubscribed. Shares rose about 5% after hours, adding roughly $220 billion in market cap, lifting peers AMD and mega-cap customers Alphabet and Microsoft, and boosting S&P 500 futures by 1%. Nvidia’s stock—up 35% year-to-date after a 1,200% three-year surge—had slipped nearly 8% in November amid bubble fears, which the results helped calm. Nvidia remains a top weight in major ETFs—approximately 10% of QQQ and 8% of SPY and VOO—and is the largest stock in the S&P 500, amplifying its market impact.
