#### [Sequoia to invest in Anthropic, breaking VC taboo on backing rivals: FT](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/18/sequoia-to-invest-in-anthropic-breaking-vc-taboo-on-backing-rivals-ft/)

Sequoia Capital is reportedly joining a massive new funding round for Anthropic, the maker of Claude, defying the traditional VC norm of not backing direct competitors in the same sector. Led by Singapore’s GIC and U.S. investor Coatue with $1.5 billion each, the round targets $25 billion or more at a $350 billion valuation—more than double Anthropic’s $170 billion figure from four months ago. Microsoft and Nvidia have committed up to $15 billion combined, with VCs and others expected to add $10 billion or more. This is notable because Sequoia already holds stakes in OpenAI and Elon Musk’s xAI, and follows prior reporting that OpenAI would restrict investor access to confidential info if they made “non-passive” investments in competitors—a policy Sam Altman described as industry standard.

Historically, Sequoia has been strict on portfolio conflicts, even walking away from its Finix investment in 2020 due to overlap with Stripe—relinquishing $21 million, a board seat, information rights, and shares. Its xAI investment was viewed as an extension of longstanding Musk ties (X/Twitter, SpaceX, The Boring Company, Neuralink) rather than a pure OpenAI rival bet. The Anthropic round also comes after leadership changes at Sequoia, with Alfred Lin and Pat Grady succeeding Roelof Botha; Lin has deep ties to Altman and publicly supported him during OpenAI’s 2023 turmoil. Anthropic is reportedly preparing for an IPO as soon as this year.

#### [Zhipu AI breaks US chip reliance with first major model trained on Huawei stack](https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-war/article/3339869/zhipu-ai-breaks-us-chip-reliance-first-major-model-trained-huawei-stack)
![](https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/canvas/2026/01/14/323c47dc-0d7f-4c26-8223-6cbbbce1ac07_550521d0.jpg?itok=JVa7Ka0z&v=1768381476)

Zhipu AI announced that its new open-source image generation model, GLM-Image, was trained entirely on a domestic Huawei stack—marking a first for a “powerful” model developed without US chips. The full training pipeline, from data prep through final training, ran on Huawei Ascend Atlas 800T A2 servers with Ascend AI processors and the MindSpore ML framework. This demonstrates the feasibility of training state-of-the-art multimodal models on China’s local hardware and software amid US export controls. Zhipu positioned the work as a reference implementation for scaling domestic compute in AI development.

Under the hood, GLM-Image uses a hybrid architecture combining autoregressive and diffusion components, enabling native multimodal capabilities across text, voice, image, and video. The design echoes approaches like Google DeepMind’s Nano Banana Pro, jointly generating high-fidelity images and coherent text. By labeling the model “powerful” and open-source, Zhipu signals both performance ambitions and community adoption potential, while emphasizing the concrete stack choices—Ascend 800T A2 + MindSpore—and the end-to-end locally sourced training pipeline as the core achievement.

#### [OpenAI to test ads in ChatGPT as it burns through billions](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/01/openai-to-test-ads-in-chatgpt-as-it-burns-through-billions/)

OpenAI will begin testing labeled banner ads in ChatGPT for logged‑in users on the free tier and the $8/month ChatGPT Go plan, rolling out in the U.S. and other markets in the coming weeks. Ads will appear as blocked-off sections at the bottom of answers when there’s a “relevant sponsored product or service,” such as travel ads after a destination query; Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise users will not see ads. OpenAI says ads won’t influence model outputs and will be clearly separated from answers, with sensitive categories like health, mental health, and politics excluded. The company is also expanding ChatGPT Go globally after initial availability in India, while emphasizing that enterprise and subscription revenue remains “strong.”

Privacy and transparency controls include not sharing user conversations with advertisers, providing only aggregated performance metrics (e.g., impressions, clicks), offering an explanation of “why this ad,” allowing users to dismiss ads, and enabling options to turn off personalization and clear data. Ads will not be served to users identified as minors or predicted under 18 by age‑prediction models. The move follows OpenAI’s April 2025 shopping features for ChatGPT Search and mirrors Google’s AdSense tests in chatbot experiences, arriving amid intensifying competition with Google’s Gemini 3, which has led recent LLM benchmarks. Users can interrogate advertised products directly in chat to inform purchases, and OpenAI frames ads as part of a diversified revenue model to make “intelligence more accessible.”
