#### [Exclusive: Nvidia buying AI chip startup Groq's assets for about $20 billion in largest deal on record](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/24/nvidia-buying-ai-chip-startup-groq-for-about-20-billion-biggest-deal.html)

Nvidia agreed to license Groq’s inference technology and acquire essentially all of its assets for about $20 billion in cash—its largest deal to date—according to Disruptive CEO Alex Davis, a major Groq investor. Groq, valued at $6.9 billion after raising $750 million three months ago, said it entered a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Nvidia and that CEO Jonathan Ross, President Sunny Madra, and other senior leaders will join Nvidia. In a note to employees, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the plan is to integrate Groq’s low-latency processors into the NVIDIA AI factory architecture to broaden support for inference and real-time workloads. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress declined comment, and Huang emphasized Nvidia is licensing Groq’s IP and hiring talent, not acquiring the company itself.

Groq will continue operating independently under CFO-turned-CEO Simon Edwards, with GroqCloud excluded from the transaction and continuing without interruption. Davis said Nvidia is receiving all of Groq’s assets aside from the nascent cloud business, effectively transferring the core chip IP and hardware. The deal follows Nvidia’s $7B Mellanox acquisition in 2019 and a September move to license tech and hire talent from Enfabrica for over $900M, reflecting a pattern of licensing-plus-acquihire structures. Nvidia ended October with $60.6B in cash and short-term investments; recent Groq investors include BlackRock, Neuberger Berman, Samsung, Cisco, Altimeter, and 1789 Capital.

#### [OpenAI opens ChatGPT to third-party apps via its Platform](https://www.testingcatalog.com/openai-opens-chatgpt-to-third-party-apps-after-review-process/)
![](https://www.testingcatalog.com/content/images/size/w1200/2025/12/Agent-builder-OpenAI-API-12-17-2025_11_33_PM.jpg)

OpenAI is now accepting submissions for third-party apps inside ChatGPT, creating an app directory where approved tools are discoverable and usable directly in the ChatGPT interface. Developers can submit apps built with OpenAI models through the developer platform; listings undergo automated and manual review for policy compliance, safety, and technical reliability before approval. Once approved, apps appear alongside built-in tools and can be invoked in conversational workflows without external installs. The rollout is global, and eligibility depends on adherence to usage policies and quality guidelines, transitioning the prior ad hoc GPT sharing toward a structured marketplace.

The program focuses on productivity, research, creative assistants, and domain-specific agents that benefit from conversational access rather than standalone UIs. While monetization details remain limited, the submission and ranking infrastructure lays groundwork for future commercial models and discovery. For developers, this offers a native distribution channel with reduced onboarding friction and added user trust; for OpenAI, it increases platform stickiness and model usage. Approved apps will be listed in a new app directory accessible in ChatGPT, enabling users to search, select, and run multiple task-specific agents in one place.

#### [Amazon has a new leader for its ‘AGI’ group as it plays catch-up on AI](https://www.theverge.com/news/846721/amazon-new-agi-leader-peter-desantis-rohit-prasad)
![](https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23935560/acastro_STK103__03.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200)

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said Rohit Prasad, head of the company’s AGI efforts and longtime Alexa leader, will leave next year as Amazon hits what he called an “inflection point” in AI. Peter DeSantis, an SVP at AWS with deep infrastructure experience, will now lead a new division spanning advanced AI models, custom chip development, and quantum computing. Prasad, who joined in 2013 and helped launch the Amazon Nova model family, has been skeptical of standard benchmarks, saying, “None of these benchmarks are real… The evals are frankly getting noisy.” Nova 2 launched earlier this month but trails rivals on public leaderboards, underscoring Amazon’s perceived lag behind Microsoft, Google, Meta, and OpenAI.

The reshuffle puts renowned AI researcher Pieter Abbeel in charge of the frontier model research team, while DeSantis unifies Amazon’s AI stack from models to hardware. This follows delays and underperformance in Alexa’s promised AI overhaul, intended to showcase Amazon’s generative capabilities. Jassy framed the reorg as consolidating momentum and focus, saying Amazon is “well-positioned to lead” given its foundation and traction. The new structure centers on closing gaps in model performance and scaling, integrating AWS compute, in-house silicon, and cutting-edge research to accelerate delivery of “meaningful capabilities” to customers.

#### [John Carreyrou and other authors bring new lawsuit against six major AI companies](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/23/john-carreyrou-and-other-authors-bring-new-lawsuit-against-six-major-ai-companies/)

 * [Adobe hit with proposed class-action, accused of misusing authors’ work in AI training](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/17/adobe-hit-with-proposed-class-action-accused-of-misusing-authors-work-in-ai-training/)

![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1371961757.jpg?resize=1200,800)

A new lawsuit filed by authors including John Carreyrou targets Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, Meta, xAI, and Perplexity, alleging the companies trained large language models on pirated copies of their books. The complaint argues that prior relief—namely the Anthropic $1.5 billion settlement offering roughly $3,000 per eligible writer—fails to address the “massive willful infringement” of using stolen books to build models that generate billions in revenue. This follows a judge’s earlier ruling that while training on pirated copies may be legal under current interpretations, the underlying act of book piracy is not, leaving a gap authors want courts to address directly. The plaintiffs say the proposed Anthropic settlement “serves the AI companies, not creators,” and seek accountability specifically for training on datasets sourced from infringing repositories.

In a parallel suit, Adobe faces a proposed class action alleging it trained its SlimLM small language model on SlimPajama-627B, which the complaint says is a derivative of RedPajama that includes the Books3 corpus of 191,000 books. Plaintiff Elizabeth Lyon claims her guidebooks appeared in a processed subset of SlimPajama, arguing Adobe relied on a deduplicated, multi-corpora dataset that nonetheless incorporated Books3 via RedPajama copying and manipulation. Books3 and RedPajama have repeatedly surfaced in litigation, including cases naming Apple Intelligence and Salesforce for alleged training on copyrighted works “without consent and without credit or compensation.” Together, these cases highlight a pattern of model pretraining pipelines citing “open-source” datasets (SlimPajama/RedPajama/Books3) that allegedly embed pirated books, with authors pushing for remedies that penalize use of those sources rather than offering low per-author payouts.

[Emergence of Human to Robot Transfer in Vision-Language-Action Models](https://www.physicalintelligence.company/research/human_to_robot). Scaling up robotic foundation models and robot training data enables them to leverage egocentric human videos without explicit alignment, yielding about a 2x improvement on robot tasks where robot data is scarce.

[T5Gemma 2: Seeing, Reading, and Understanding Longer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14856). Lightweight encoder-decoder LLMs (270M–4B) pretrained on ~2T tokens with multimodal vision inputs, tied embeddings, merged attention, and extended positional interpolation handle long contexts up to 128K while matching or exceeding comparable decoder-only baselines.

[LLaDA2.0: Scaling Up Diffusion Language Models to 100B](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15745). The authors convert pretrained autoregressive checkpoints into diffusion-style masked reconstruction models using two-stage continual pretraining (Warmup–Stable–Decay plus document-level masking) and a post-training pipeline (complementary masking, DPO-style alignment, and confidence prediction) to produce instruction-tuned 16B and 100B models optimized for parallel decoding and deployment.

[Let's (not) just put things in Context: Test-Time Training for Long-Context LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13898). The paper identifies “score dilution” in static self-attention as a key failure mode for long-context tasks and proposes query-only test-time training (qTTT)—a lightweight method that updates only attention query projections at inference—to increase target–distractor logit separation and improve retrieval and multi-hop reasoning under matched FLOP budgets.

[Nemotron-Cascade: Scaling Cascaded Reinforcement Learning for General-Purpose Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13607). Scaling a sequential, domain-by-domain cascaded reinforcement learning pipeline on 8B/14B Qwen3 bases yields unified thinking/non-thinking models that match or exceed specialized reasoning and code models across many benchmarks, with open training recipes and released models.

[Universal Reasoning Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14693). The study demonstrates that recurring, depth-wise nonlinear computation and modest architectural tweaks (short convolutions and truncated backpropagation) make parameter‑efficient Universal Transformers substantially better at multi-step abstract reasoning tasks like ARC‑AGI and Sudoku, achieving higher pass@1 accuracy and faster convergence under matched budgets.

[SonicMoE: Accelerating MoE with IO and Tile-aware Optimizations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14080). A co-designed set of software and routing optimizations—including a backward-pass memory-saving algorithm, IO-overlapping MoE kernels for Blackwell/Hopper GPUs, and a tile-aligned token-rounding router—reduces activation memory, increases training throughput (up to ~50%+ on a 7B MoE and up to 16% further with token rounding), and eliminates GEMM padding waste without harming accuracy.

[VL-JEPA: Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture for Vision-language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10942). A joint image-text embedding model with a predictive training objective delivers strong multi-task performance across vision-language benchmarks while keeping model size and architectural changes minimal.

[Activation Oracles: Training and Evaluating LLMs as General-Purpose Activation Explainers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15674). Trained on a diverse mixture of LatentQA-style tasks (system-prompt QA, binary classification, and a novel self-supervised context prediction), these models accept activation vectors from different layers and generalize to out-of-distribution auditing tasks, outperforming prior white- and black-box methods.

[Kling-Omni Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16776). A unified framework combines a new multimodal vision-language interaction paradigm with a single architecture to perform diverse video generation, editing, and reasoning tasks while improving user control and intention inference.

[Flowception: Temporally Expansive Flow Matching for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11438). The approach interleaves continuous flow-matching denoising with stochastic frame insertions to generate variable-length videos efficiently, reducing error accumulation and attention cost compared with full-sequence and autoregressive methods.

[Feedforward 3D Editing via Text-Steerable Image-to-3D](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13678). The Steer3D method augments pretrained image-to-3D models with a ControlNet-based text steering module and trains on an automatically synthesized dataset of ~9.7M edit pairs using flow matching and Direct Preference Optimization to enable fast, feedforward 3D edits that better preserve consistency.

[Seedance 1.5 pro: A Native Audio-Visual Joint Generation Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13507). A dual-branch diffusion-transformer with cross-modal integration, post-training optimizations, and an acceleration framework produces tightly synchronized audio-visual outputs.

[Adaptation of Agentic AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16301). A unified taxonomy divides adaptation into agent-focused (A1/A2) and tool-focused (T1/T2) strategies, analyzes trade-offs, and surveys methods, applications, and open challenges for improving agentic AI performance and generalization.
