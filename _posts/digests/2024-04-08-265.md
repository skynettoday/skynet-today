### Top News

#### [Tesla Full Self-Driving Comes Out Of Beta, But Must Be Supervised](https://insideevs.com/news/714524/tesla-fsd-beta-supervised-name/)

Tesla has officially removed the "Beta" label from its Full Self-Driving (FSD) software, now referring to it as "Full Self-Driving (Supervised)." This change comes after a year of anticipation following CEO Elon Musk's announcement of the upcoming shift. The new name aims to clarify that while the vehicle can make certain decisions independently, it still requires supervision from the driver. Despite the name change, Tesla has faced criticism from regulatory bodies worldwide for its choice of branding, with some arguing that it is misleading and has led to a series of legal issues. The company has also expanded access to FSD by offering a one-month free trial to all owners with compatible vehicles, potentially increasing the adoption rate of the $12,000 add-on.

#### [â€˜The machine did it coldlyâ€™: Israel used AI to identify 37,000 Hamas targets](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/03/israel-gaza-ai-database-hamas-airstrikes)
![](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e2b277c72ab2d1978b8a795b09cd8b3215d93f6/0_285_5151_3091/master/5151.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=80a6607fe59176c3d1673e18aea5a264)

The Israeli military used an AI-powered database, named Lavender, to identify 37,000 potential targets linked to Hamas during its bombing campaign in Gaza, according to intelligence sources. Developed by the Israel Defense Forces' elite intelligence division, Unit 8200, Lavender processed large amounts of data to identify potential "junior" operatives. The system's use has raised legal and moral questions about the relationship between military personnel and machines in warfare. The intelligence sources also claimed that the Israeli military allowed a large number of Palestinian civilian casualties, particularly in the early stages of the conflict, with pre-authorised allowances for estimated civilian deaths before a strike was authorised.

#### [Amazon Ditches 'Just Walk Out' Checkouts at Its Grocery Stores](https://gizmodo.com/amazon-reportedly-ditches-just-walk-out-grocery-stores-1851381116)
![](https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/8d8649b90003335ade8b9697a20cb86f.jpg)

Amazon is discontinuing its "Just Walk Out" technology in its grocery stores, a system that used cameras and sensors to track customers' purchases and allowed them to leave the store without physically checking out. The technology, which was dependent on over 1,000 people in India reviewing and labeling videos for accuracy, will be replaced by Dash Carts, a scanner and screen embedded in shopping carts that allows customers to check out as they shop. Amazon is also introducing self-checkout counters for non-Amazon members. Despite the change, Amazon will continue to use the "Just Walk Out" technology in a few of its Amazon Fresh stores in the UK and some Amazon Go convenience stores.

#### [A conversation with OpenAIâ€™s first artist in residence](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/03/29/1090335/a-conversation-with-openais-first-artist-in-residence/)
![](https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_0548-detail.jpeg?resize=1200,600)

Alexander Reben, the first artist in residence at OpenAI, has been working with the AI firm for several years, even before his official appointment in January. Reben was invited to experiment with an early version of GPT-3, OpenAI's language prediction model, five years ago and has since created several artworks using the system. With a background in math and robotics from MIT's Media Lab, Reben is particularly interested in the interaction between humans and machines. He views AI as a tool rather than a defining aspect of his work, and is intrigued by how humanity and technology co-evolve over time. Currently, he serves as the director of technology and research at Stochastic Labs, a nonprofit incubator for artists and engineers.
