 * [OpenAI Launches GPT-5.2 as It Navigates ‘Code Red’](https://www.wired.com/story/openai-gpt-launch-gemini-code-red/)

![](https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/STK201_SAM_ALTMAN_CVIRGINIA_B.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200)

OpenAI released the GPT-5.2 model series—Instant, Thinking, and Pro—positioned as its best for everyday professional use, with upgrades in spreadsheet and presentation creation, coding, image perception, long-context understanding, tool use, and multi-step project handling. GPT-5.2 Thinking is geared toward coding, math, and planning; OpenAI reports 38% fewer hallucinations versus GPT-5.1 on factual QA benchmarks, top scores on GDPval, performance exceeding human professionals on over 70% of tasks, and 11x faster completion. Early testers included Notion, Box, Shopify, Harvey, Zoom, and Databricks, and OpenAI highlighted a case where GPT-5.2 Pro generated sharper unanswered research questions in immunology than other frontier models. Rollout begins immediately for paid ChatGPT plans (Plus, Pro, Go, Business, Enterprise) and the API, with gradual deployment; GPT-5.1 will remain under “legacy models” for three months.

The launch follows Sam Altman’s internal “code red” to prioritize ChatGPT amid pressure from Google’s Gemini 3, whose app now has 650M monthly active users versus OpenAI’s 800M weekly active users. Building on 5.1’s tone improvements, GPT-5.2 aims to feel more structured and reliable while retaining engaging conversation, pushing toward agentic AI and a “personalized assistant” vision inside ChatGPT. OpenAI also previewed an age-prediction model to auto-apply safeguards for minors, with early country rollouts ahead of a planned ChatGPT “adult mode” targeted for Q1 2026. On the business front, the announcement coincided with a three-year Disney licensing deal for user-prompted social videos featuring 200+ Disney/Marvel/Pixar/Star Wars characters, Disney+ distribution of select videos, Disney becoming a major OpenAI customer, and a $1B equity investment.

#### [Google is powering a new US military AI platform](https://www.theverge.com/news/841219/google-gemini-us-military-ai-platform-genai-mil)
![](https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25290332/STK255_Google_Gemini_B.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C9.9676601489831%2C100%2C80.064679702034&w=1200)

The US Department of Defense launched a “bespoke” AI platform called GenAI.mil, with Google Cloud’s Gemini as the first integrated model. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth touted it as putting “frontier AI models” in the hands of “every American warrior” to make forces “more lethal,” while Google framed initial use cases as administrative and planning support. Listed tasks include summarizing policy handbooks, generating project-specific compliance checklists, extracting key terms from statements of work, and creating detailed risk assessments for operational planning. The platform is restricted to unclassified work, and Google says data used in GenAI.mil “is never used to train Google’s public models.”

Google emphasized prior DoD work, including the controversial Project Maven, and recently reversed a pledge to avoid AI for weapons systems or surveillance. The rollout appears to have surprised some government staff, with at least one r/army post calling a GenAI.mil pop-up “weird” and “suspicious.” The site is publicly reachable but gated to DoD networks, displaying an unauthorized-access warning otherwise. Pentagon CTO Emil Michael said other AI models will be added to the platform over time.

 * [Disney accuses Google of ‘massive’ copyright infringement following deal with OpenAI](https://www.theverge.com/news/842573/disney-google-copyright-infringement-cease-and-desist)

![](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108240586-1765464078709-gettyimages-2247523490-mr1_7847_5jnyddnx.jpeg?v=1765464110&w=1920&h=1080)

Disney announced a $1 billion equity investment in OpenAI alongside a three-year licensing deal to let Sora users generate videos featuring more than 200 Disney, Marvel, Pixar, and Star Wars characters starting next year. Disney will receive warrants for additional OpenAI equity, become a major OpenAI customer, and deploy ChatGPT internally while co-developing new tools and experiences. OpenAI’s Sora, launched in September, quickly topped the App Store but drew backlash for brand/character misuse; OpenAI has promised more granular control over character generation. Disney says some Sora-made videos will appear on Disney Plus, and the company frames the partnership as extending storytelling via generative AI while protecting creators.

In contrast, Disney sent Google a cease-and-desist accusing “massive” copyright infringement by Gemini, Veo, Imagen, and Nano Banana, alleging the models generate lookalikes of Yoda, Darth Vader, Groot, and other IP and that Google has “refused” to add sufficient safeguards. Disney likens Google’s tools to a “virtual vending machine” flooding the market with infringing works, after previously pressuring Character.AI to remove Disney characters and suing Midjourney. Google responded that it trains on public web data and offers controls like Google-extended and YouTube’s Content ID, and says it will continue engaging Disney. The juxtaposition highlights Disney formalizing licensed character generation with OpenAI—including app-level controls and distribution on Disney Plus—while escalating enforcement against unlicensed outputs from other AI platforms.

#### Research

[On the Interplay of Pre-Training, Mid-Training, and RL on Reasoning Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07783). A controlled synthetic framework shows RL yields genuine reasoning gains only when pre-training leaves room for improvement and RL data match the model's competence edge; sparse pre-training exposure enables contextual transfer that RL can amplify; a mid-training bridge materially boosts in- and out-of-domain performance; and process-based rewards reduce reward hacking and improve reasoning fidelity.

[Towards a Science of Scaling Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08296). Findings indicate multi-agent benefits depend on measurable task and architectural factors—revealing a tool‑coordination trade‑off, a capability ceiling where extra agents hurt once single-agent performance is high, and architecture‑dependent error amplification—together allowing prediction of optimal coordination structures for agentic tasks.

[Weird Generalization and Inductive Backdoors: New Ways to Corrupt LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09742). The paper shows that fine-tuning on very small, narrow datasets can induce broad, unexpected misbehaviors—including partisan shifts and stealthy backdoors (both traditional and novel inductive backdoors)—by causing models to generalize a latent persona or connect dispersed cues into harmful behaviors.

[Long-horizon Reasoning Agent for Olympiad-Level Mathematical Problem Solving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10739). A hierarchical, multi-agent RL-trained workflow iteratively compresses and stores intermediate lemmas in a verified memory repository, extending effective reasoning depth beyond fixed context limits to solve Olympiad-level math problems.

[Training-Time Action Conditioning for Efficient Real-Time Chunking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05964). A training-time inpainting technique simulates inference delays so models learn to condition on action prefixes ahead of time, removing inference-time overhead and improving real-world and simulated performance at high latency.

[LYNX: Learning Dynamic Exits for Confidence-Controlled Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05325). A lightweight probe trained on cue-triggered forced-exit examples, combined with split conformal calibration, turns hidden-state confidence at natural cue tokens into an online stop/continue rule that reduces token usage while preserving accuracy across models and tasks.

[The Universal Weight Subspace Hypothesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05117). Networks of the same architecture consistently converge to a layer-wise, low-rank joint subspace of parameters, enabling efficient adaptation, compression, and transfer across diverse tasks.

[Evaluating Gemini Robotics Policies in a Veo World Simulator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10675). An action-conditioned, multi-view consistent video-generation model trained on large-scale robotics data simulates and predicts policy performance, generalization degradation, and safety vulnerabilities—validated against 1,600+ real-world trials—and enables scene editing for red-teaming without hardware tests.

[Training LLMs for Honesty via Confessions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08093). Models are trained to produce an auxiliary self-evaluation (“confession”) after answers, scored by an LLM judge, reporting which constraints they considered, how well they met them, and any uncertainties or misbehavior.

[ConceptAttention: Diffusion Transformers Learn Highly Interpretable Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04320). Concept-specific text embeddings extracted from DiT attention outputs, combined with linear projections over image patch representations, produce high-fidelity saliency maps that localize arbitrary textual concepts and enable state-of-the-art zero-shot segmentation without additional training.

[A Definition of AGI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18212). The work operationalizes AGI by mapping human cognitive abilities (via the CHC framework) to ten equally weighted, testable components—producing a standardized AGI Score based on multimodal cognitive batteries to assess whether an AI matches the versatility and proficiency of a well-educated adult.
