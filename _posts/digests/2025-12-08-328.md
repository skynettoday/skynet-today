#### [Amazon releases an impressive new AI chip and teases an Nvidia-friendly roadmap](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/amazon-releases-an-impressive-new-ai-chip-and-teases-a-nvidia-friendly-roadmap/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-1136663877.jpg?resize=1200,800)

At re:Invent 2025, AWS introduced Trainium3 and the Trainium3 UltraServer, claiming major gen-over-gen gains with a strong emphasis on efficiency. The 3 nm Trainium3 chip powers UltraServers with 144 chips each, and AWS says workloads run 4x faster with 4x more memory than the previous generation, for both training and inference. Using AWS’s homegrown networking, thousands of UltraServers can be linked to scale up to 1 million Trainium3 chips—10x the prior max cluster size. Energy efficiency is a key selling point, with AWS touting 40% lower energy use per task versus last gen, which should reduce power draw and customer costs. Early adopters including Anthropic, Karakuri, SplashMusic, and Decart have reportedly lowered inference costs with the new hardware.

Looking ahead, AWS previewed Trainium4, now in development, with another sizable performance jump and—crucially—support for Nvidia’s NVLink Fusion interconnect. That would allow future Trainium4 systems to interoperate with Nvidia GPUs while leveraging AWS’s cost-optimized racks, potentially easing adoption for CUDA-centric AI stacks. The interoperability could make it simpler to extend Nvidia-based workflows onto AWS Trainium infrastructure without leaving the Nvidia ecosystem. No release date was given, but AWS hinted more details may come at next year’s re:Invent.

#### [Mistral closes in on Big AI rivals with new open-weight frontier and small models](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/mistral-closes-in-on-big-ai-rivals-with-mistral-3-open-weight-frontier-and-small-models/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2147859992-e1713960898378.webp?resize=1200,676)

Mistral unveiled the Mistral 3 family: one open-weight frontier model (Mistral Large 3) plus nine smaller “Ministral 3” models spanning 14B, 8B, and 3B parameters in Base, Instruct, and Reasoning variants. Large 3 is a multimodal, multilingual model using a granular Mixture of Experts with 41B active parameters out of 675B total and a 256k context window, positioned for document analysis, coding, AI assistants, and workflow automation. It joins the small cohort of open frontier models that integrate vision and language in one system, comparable to Llama 3 and Qwen3-Omni, rather than pairing separate LLM and vision models. Mistral argues initial benchmarks understate its value because customization and fine-tuning on enterprise data often close the gap with closed models.

On the deployment front, Ministral 3 targets practicality: all variants support vision, 128k–256k context windows, and multilingual use, and are designed to run offline on a single GPU for on-prem, laptops, edge devices, or robots. Mistral claims the small models can match or outperform larger closed systems after fine-tuning, with higher efficiency and fewer tokens generated for equivalent tasks. The company emphasizes cost and reliability versus API-only closed providers and is pushing into “physical AI” with integrations in robots, drones, and vehicles. Active collaborations include Singapore’s HTX (robots, cybersecurity, fire safety), Helsing (vision-language-action for drones), and Stellantis (in-car assistant).

#### [DeepSeek Releases New Reasoning Models to Match GPT-5, Rival Gemini 3 Pro](https://analyticsindiamag.com/ai-news-updates/deepseek-releases-new-reasoning-models-to-match-gpt-5-rival-gemini-3-pro/)

![](https://analyticsindiamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/deepseek-whale.jpg)

DeepSeek released two open-source reasoning-first models, DeepSeek-V3.2 and DeepSeek-V3.2-Speciale, on Hugging Face, with V3.2 live across its app, web, and API, and Speciale temporarily available via API until December 15, 2025. V3.2 succeeds V3.2-Exp and targets “GPT-5 level performance,” balancing inference efficiency with long-context handling while integrating “Thinking in Tool-Use” so structured reasoning operates within and alongside external tool calls; Speciale is priced the same but lacks tool-call support. DeepSeek says Speciale rivals Gemini 3.0 Pro and achieves gold-level (expert) results across competitive benchmarks like IMO, CMO, and ICPC World Finals; other reports add wins at IMO 2025 and IOI. The release expands DeepSeek’s agent-training approach with a synthetic dataset of 1,800+ environments and 85,000 complex instructions, and the company also highlighted its open-weight DeepSeekMath-V2 for theorem proving and gold-level IMO 2025 scores.

Earlier coverage of V3.2-Exp emphasized sparse attention as a key technical innovation for speed and cost, citing over 50% API cost reductions and improved computational efficiency, with strengths in logical/quantitative reasoning and creative tasks (e.g., SVG animation, SaaS landing pages, browser-based OS UIs). Those reports also note trade-offs: limitations on very long-context tasks and occasional issues with intricate icon generation, with future refinement planned in a DeepSeek R2 line. One report claims V3.2 has 685 billion parameters, underscoring heavy server requirements despite DeepSeek’s open-source stance. Practically, V3.2 keeps API usage patterns consistent with prior versions, while Speciale is positioned for high-end reasoning workloads and benchmark parity or superiority versus GPT-5 High and Gemini 3.0 Pro, according to the company.

#### [Runway rolls out new AI video model that beats Google, OpenAI in key benchmark](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/01/runway-gen-4-5-video-model-google-open-ai.html)
![](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108162827-1750712201805-gettyimages-2207801548-AA_04042025_2159477.jpeg?v=1764542788&w=1920&h=1080)

Runway launched Gen-4.5, a new text-to-video model that generates high-definition clips from written prompts specifying motion and action. The company says the model excels at physics consistency, realistic human motion, coherent camera movements, and cause-and-effect reasoning, addressing common failure modes in video generation like object drift and temporal flicker. In blind A/B comparisons on the independent Video Arena benchmark by Artificial Analysis, Gen-4.5 ranks No. 1 overall for text-to-video quality. Voters compare pairs of outputs without seeing model identities, and Gen-4.5 beat competitors across categories emphasizing motion fidelity and scene coherence.

On the current leaderboard, Google’s Veo 3 sits at No. 2, while OpenAI’s Sora 2 Pro is at No. 7, highlighting a notable gap in head-to-head user preference for Runway’s outputs. Runway emphasizes that a small, focused team—about 100 employees—developed the model, underscoring efficiency in training and iteration against much larger rivals. Key capabilities include better handling of human biomechanics, consistent object interactions under physical constraints, and smoother, controllable camera paths. CEO Cristóbal Valenzuela framed the result as evidence that careful model design and evaluation can outpace scale alone in video generation quality.

#### [Black Forest Labs raises $300M at $3.25B valuation](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/black-forest-labs-raises-300m-at-3-25b-valuation/)

Black Forest Labs raised $300 million in a Series B at a $3.25 billion valuation, co-led by Salesforce Ventures and Anjney Midha (AMP), with participation from a16z, NVIDIA, Northzone, Creandum, Earlybird VC, BroadLight Capital, General Catalyst, Temasek, Bain Capital Ventures, Air Street Capital, Visionaries Club, Canva, and Figma Ventures. The company said the funds will go toward research and development. Black Forest Labs builds foundation AI models for image generation and editing and has seen rapid adoption since launching in August 2024. Its models power image features in products from Adobe, fal.ai, Picsart, ElevenLabs, VSCO, Vercel, and previously underpinned image generation in Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot.

Recently, the startup released Flux 2, an image generation model with improved text and image rendering, support for up to 10 reference images to preserve style and tone, and output up to 4K resolution. Flux 2 emphasizes better text fidelity within images, a common shortcoming of prior models, while adding multi-image conditioning for consistent aesthetics. The company’s founding team—Robin Rombach, Patrick Esser, and Andreas Blattmann—previously helped create Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion, underscoring their experience in diffusion-based generative models. Black Forest Labs’ fast growth and large customer integrations position Flux 2 as a competitive alternative in the image model space.
