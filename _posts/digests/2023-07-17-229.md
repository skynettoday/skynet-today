#### [Thousands of authors sign letter urging AI makers to stop stealing books](https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/18/thousands-of-authors-sign-letter-urging-ai-makers-to-stop-stealing-books/)

More than 8,500 authors have signed an open letter urging tech companies behind large language models like ChatGPT and Bard to stop using their writing without permission or compensation. The authors argue that these AI systems mimic and regurgitate their language, stories, style, and ideas without proper attribution. They express concern that generative AI threatens their profession by flooding the market with mediocre, machine-written books, stories, and journalism based on their work. The letter calls on the companies to obtain permission for the use of copyrighted material, compensate writers fairly for past and ongoing use, and compensate writers for the use of their works in AI output. The authors highlight the harm caused to their livelihoods, particularly for newer authors and under-represented communities.

#### [Is ChatGPT getting worse over time? Study claims yes, but others aren’t sure](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/is-chatgpt-getting-worse-over-time-study-claims-yes-but-others-arent-sure/)

A recent research paper by Stanford University and UC Berkeley claims that OpenAI's language model, GPT-4, has shown a decline in performance over time. The study tested GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on various tasks and found that GPT-4's accuracy in identifying prime numbers dropped significantly from 97.6% to 2.4% between March and June 2023. However, some experts argue that the findings are not conclusive and may be attributed to fine-tuning adjustments made by OpenAI. OpenAI has consistently denied any decrease in GPT-4's capabilities. The study raises concerns about how OpenAI handles model releases.

#### [Meta is giving away its AI tech to try to beat ChatGPT](https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/18/23799025/meta-ai-llama-2-open-source-microsoft)

Meta, formerly known as Facebook, has announced that it is open-sourcing its large language model LLaMA 2, making it free for commercial and research use. This move puts Meta in direct competition with OpenAI's GPT-4, which powers tools like ChatGPT and Microsoft Bing. LLaMA 2 was trained on 40% more data than its predecessor and outperforms other language models in reasoning, coding, proficiency, and knowledge tests. Meta's decision to open up LLaMA aims to improve safety and transparency, as the model has been tested for safety and evaluated both internally and externally. LLaMA 2 will be available through Microsoft's Azure platform, as well as other providers like AWS and Hugging Face. The key takeaway is that Meta's open approach allows for collaboration and problem-solving within the AI community.

#### [Google Tests A.I. Tool That Is Able to Write News Articles](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/19/business/google-artificial-intelligence-news-articles.html)
![](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/07/19/multimedia/19google-ai-vzbq/19google-ai-vzbq-facebookJumbo.jpg)

Google is currently testing an artificial intelligence tool called Genesis that can generate news articles by taking in information about current events. The tool is being pitched to news organizations like The New York Times and The Washington Post. Google sees Genesis as a personal assistant for journalists, automating certain tasks to free up their time. However, some executives find the tool unsettling, as it seems to overlook the effort required to produce accurate and well-crafted news stories. The key takeaway from the article is that Google is exploring the use of AI in news production, which could have implications for the publishing industry.
