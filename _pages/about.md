## What is this
As it says up there, Skynet Today is a site dedicated to providing accessible and informed written criticism of the latest AI hype and panic. In other words, the idea is to post a concise but comprehensive overview of each major AI story that bubbles up in popular media. Such stories have happened more and more often in the past several years. The hope is to get a variety of people knowledgeable about AI to cover the coverage of new events related to AI and so make it clear what is misinformation and what is actually worth paying attention to. 


## Who are you
We are a group of researchers and engineers with domain knowledge in AI who collaborate toward this site's goal in our spare time. People actively contributing to the site include:
* [Andrey Kurenkov](http://www.andreykurenkov.com/): The site's creator, lead editor, and occasional contributor of news coverage and editorials. Andrey has BS Computer Science and Electrical Engineering degrees from Georgia Tech, and is currently a graduate student at Stanford where he studies and is doing research in AI. He likes writing [blog posts](http://www.andreykurenkov.com/writing/) about miscallenous topics and has [written](http://www.andreykurenkov.com/writing/ai/a-brief-history-of-neural-nets-and-deep-learning/) [several](http://www.andreykurenkov.com/writing/ai/a-brief-history-of-game-ai/) long-form educational posts about AI. 
* [Josh Morton](https://joshuamorton.github.io/): A contributing author of news coverage and editorials. Josh has a BS CS degree from Georgia Tech, and is currently a software engineer at Google. While at GT he worked in the Robotics and Intelligent Machines Lab as well as The Agency (Geogia Tech's AI club). He likes to juggle.
* [Ben Shih](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benshih/): A contributing author of news coverage and editorials. Ben has BS CS and MS CS degrees from Carnegie Mellon University, and is currently completing a PhD in Mechanical Engineering focused on robotics at University of California, San Diego. He likes squishy robots.

## Why are you doing this
We believe this needs to be done, that no one is really doing it, and that we have enough relevant knowledge to do it well. 

## But surely you are aware AI is an existential threat
Yes, we are quite aware of the [existential threat](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html) possibilities of AI. The counterpoint to all that is wonderfully conveyed by [Rodney Brooks](https://rodneybrooks.com/the-seven-deadly-sins-of-predicting-the-future-of-ai/); an AGI or even scary doom AI is certainly possible, but we still seem far from it. In any case, this site's focus will be on providing perspective on stories in the here and now, not hypotheticals about the future.
